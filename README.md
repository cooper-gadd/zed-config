# Zed Editor Configuration

My personal configuration for the Zed editor.

## Why Zed?

Zed changed my perspective on text editors. I used to be a die-hard VSCode fan, but I can't go back now.

## Zed is Fast

Zed spoils me. The only time I've ever experienced speed this drastic was when:

1. I rode a motorcycle for the first time
2. I switched from NPM to Bun

## Zed Made Me a Better Programmer

Zed doesn't have the same git integration as VSCode, so I had to learn how to use the command line.

> I started out typing the full commands, and I did this for many months.

Then I saw my friend use git shortcuts. This led to me configuring my `~/.zshrc` file. I didn't even know I could do that!

From there, my need for customization grew:

- I was always content with (mostly) default settings and themes
- I discovered that I could create my own theme in Zed!
- I learned that I could customize my settings in Zed!
- All I need to do is edit a JSON file!

## Configuration People Are Not Crazy

I used to think that people who tweak their Neovim configuration were crazy. I thought that they were wasting their time.

**I was wrong. I was so wrong.**

*This is a lot of fun.*

## Vim Mode

I'm debating this... Maybe I'll try it out sometime.
